## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements algorithms for **fair rank aggregation** under the notion of **Proportionate Fairness (p-fairness)**.

In many real-world decision-making systems (hiring, admissions, recommendations, resource allocation), multiple evaluators provide rankings over a set of candidates. Traditional rank aggregation focuses only on minimizing disagreement with these rankings. However, it may produce unfair results when candidates belong to protected groups.

This implementation ensures that the final aggregated ranking:

* Minimizes disagreement with input rankings (Kemeny / Kendall-Tau distance)
* Enforces proportionate representation of protected groups at **every prefix position**
* Supports both binary and multi-valued protected attributes

---

## ⚖️ Proportionate Fairness (p-fairness)

Let:

* `f(p)` = fraction of items belonging to protected group `p`
* `k` = prefix length

A ranking is **p-fair** if for every `k`:

```
#items of group p in top k ∈ { floor(f(p)·k), ceil(f(p)·k) }
```

This ensures fairness at **every ranking position**, which is stronger than standard top-k fairness or statistical parity.

## 🎯 Problems Implemented

### 1️⃣ Individual p-Fairness (IPF)

**Input:** A single ranking ρ
**Output:** A p-fair ranking σ minimizing Kendall-Tau distance to ρ.

This problem is useful as a building block for fair rank aggregation.

---

### 2️⃣ Rank Aggregation under p-Fairness (RAPF)

**Input:** Multiple rankings ρ₁, ρ₂, ..., ρₘ
**Output:** A p-fair ranking σ minimizing total Kemeny distance:

```
κ(σ) = Σ K(σ, ρᵢ)
```

RAPF is NP-hard, so approximation frameworks are implemented.
